It will ask you\nto provide username, access_token and server address of DataHub.\n\n\nThe config is stored in \n~/.dpm/config\n, you can edit it with text editor.\nSimple example config file can look like this:\n\n\nusername = myname\naccess_token = mykey\nserver = server URL for publishing Eg: https://www.datapackaged.com\n\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nPublish\n\n\nTo publish a Data Package, go to the Data Package directory (with \ndatapackage.json\n) and\nrun:\n\n\ndpm publish\n\n\n\nIf your configured \nusername\n and \naccess_token\n are correct, dpm will\nupload datapackage.json and all relevant resources to the registry server.\n\n\nTag\n\n\nTo create historical snapshot of your data, you can tag previously uploaded datapackage on the server. Use \ndpm tag\n command:\n\n\ncd datapackage-dir\ndpm tag v1.1\n\nThis will copy the latest version of the Data Package to a separate location in the BitStore. This way you will be able keep a copy of your Data Package at this particular point in time.\n\n\nDelete\n\n\nYou have two choices: delete Data Package completely from the server (\npurge\n) or make the datapackage invisible to everyone except you (\ndelete\n). You can use \ndpm purge\n and \ndpm delete\n accordingly:\n\n\ncd datapackage-dir\ndpm delete\n# or purge it completely\ndpm purge\n\n\n\nUndelete\n\n\nYou can restore your Data Package using \nundelete\n command.\n\n\ndpm undelete\n\nNote that this only works on packages with soft delete (\ndpm delete\n), you can not undelete ones with hard delete (\ndpm purge\n)\n\n\nLinks\n\n\n\n\nCode repo",
