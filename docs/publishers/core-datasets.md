g# Core Datasets

**Core Datasets** - important, commonly used datasets in high quality, easy-to-use & open form like GDP or ISO-codes. 

The main characteristics of core datasets:

* **High Quality & Reliable** - sourcing, normalizing and quality checking a set of **key reference and indicator datasets such as country codes, currencies, GDP and population**

* **Standardized & Bulk** - all datasets provided in a **standardized** form and can be accessed in **bulk as CSV** together with a simple **JSON schema**

* **Versioned & Packaged** - all data is in **data packages** and is **versioned** using git so all changes are visible and data can be **collaboratively maintained**

**Contribute - Become a Core Data Curator**
We need help suggesting, preparing and maintaining a set of "core" datasets as Data Packages. Note that:

* We package data rather than create it – our focus is to take source data and ensure it is of high quality and in a standard form
* We preserve a clean separation between the data source, the data package and this registry – for example, data packages are stored in git repos hosted separately (preferably github)
