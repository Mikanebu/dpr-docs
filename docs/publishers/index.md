# Getting started

Let's get started then!

## Getting data in

### Prepare

Data Package Registry loads and stores data in various formats according to the [Data Package specification](http://specs.frictionlessdata.io/), incluing common data formats such as CSV and JSON. Read this section of the documentation to learn how to ensure your data is ready to add to Data Package Registry.

### Package

Data Package Registry "understands" the contents of a source data file via another "descriptor" called a [Data Package](http://specs.frictionlessdata.io/). Learn about packaging your data as a Data Package.

### Upload

It is possible to upload Data Packages into the Data Package Registry with dpm-py CLI. (or via a web site - in the future)
